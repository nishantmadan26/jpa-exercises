1) In EmployeeWithFieldAccess when we give @Id annotation at field the default is FieldAccess so there is no need to specify the
   AccessType.FieldType.As it uses the java reflection to achieve the same.

2) In EmployeeWithMixedAccess we can give the @Id annotation at field as the AccessType.FieldType is at Entity level and the
    AccessType.PropertyType is at method getEmailAddress so it will create a new column named email_address in DB.

3) In EmployeeWithPropertyAccess we can only give the @Id annotation at method as the AccessType.PropertyType is at Entity level.

The table structure would be same for all the 3 classes.
