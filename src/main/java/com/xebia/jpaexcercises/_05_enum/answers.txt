Using Ordinal as EnumType will set the attribute position starting from 0 defined in the EmployeeType enum
and store it in database as int(11) type column.
FULL_TIME,                  ->  0 (these are the positions for ordinal)
PART_TIME,                  ->  1
CONTRACTOR                  ->  2
Whereas EnumType.STRING will set the employeeType value as string {VARCHAR(255)} in the database table.
